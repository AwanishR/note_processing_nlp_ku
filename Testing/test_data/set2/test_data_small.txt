Met over the phone to go over TOB #1.  Did chantix last year and it helped but did not have the right mindset going into it.  Going to try it again in June.  He wants to quit and knows he can do it in June. Doing it with his wife.  He has quit before so he has confidence he can do it again.  tobacco free. Smoke free. No diabetes.
