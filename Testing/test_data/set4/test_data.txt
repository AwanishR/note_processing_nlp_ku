4/2/2013  Called member to review KYN results- member is asleep , a female that identified herself as his wife states she can take the information.  Explained to her that without the members authorization I cannot disclose any personal health information to her.  She insisted that she has authorization to talk with all his other providers.   I explained that I realize she has authorization at his other providers but we do not have that information on file here at DDHC.  She stated she would get Mr. Jones up and have him give me the authorization- advised her that he could just call back, not to interrupt him while he is sleeping.  She stated he will not be up until 8pm tonight, and will get off about 6:30am.  I heard her yelling to someone, she stated ?this is the people that was at your work- can you give them authorization to talk to me?- I heard a male voice in the background  state ?yes?.  Did not have opportunity to verify that the male person was the  member or ask his birthdate.  The female then got back on the phone and I tried to explain that I had not had opportunity to verify the members identity by having him say his name and date of birth- asked if she could  take my number and have him call me.  She was very short and stated that she would not ask him anything, nor would she write down our number to have him call back, that we would just have to call back when we think we can reach him.  Then she hung up the phone.

1105  Member return my call.  He doesn?t have a physician at this time but will be selecting one.  He has not had his bp rechecked since the screening, states he had been doing some pretty heavy lifting the morning of the screening, at work.

4/1/2013  Received message from member, she had called in on 3/26 stated her physician told her to watch her diet and exercise, that her A1c was elevated.   Called member back, left her a message to please return my call.  KWellsRN
4/3/2013  Member called, states she did see md in March, was told she was at a moderate risk to develop diabetes, that she should watch her diet and she should exercise more.  States the md office told her that her a1c was elevated but she does not know what the number was- stated md did not repeat any labs at the March visit.   She does not recall having any symptoms of diabetes- no excessive thirst or urination, undue fatigue or weight loss.  Her mother was a diet controlled diabetic.
Her doctor prescribed  Tricor to help with her triglyceride level, but she has not started taking it yet.  Has concerns about possible side effects, as she was unable to tolerate simvastatin- it caused her to ache badly in her joints. Discussed the mechanism that causes the muscle ache/joint pain.  Encouraged her to try the medication, and if she has undesirable side effects she can talk with md about what to do (possibly decrease or stagger doses- but not to do any of these without checking first with MD).  It would be best to at least try the medication, and hopefully she can tolerate it and it will be effective in lowering her triglycerides, which was over 600 at last check.  
Discussed with her the things she can do also to help decrease her A1c as well as her triglycerides:  In particular: Cut down or cut out pre-prepared foods, eating out, pre-processed food.  Drink water instead of soda, or at least drink diet soda.  Increase fruits and vegetables in her diet, and fiber- use whole grain bread (she is already doing this).  Make sure she is getting lean protein at every meal.  Eat more baked/broiled fish/chicken.  She should exercise daily-  she has a pretty large yard and feels she can walk two laps every day for exercise. 
Mailed member educational materials:  All About Pre-Diabetes, Cholesterol Highway, How Can I Lower High Cholesterol?, You Don?t Have To Knock Yourself Out to Prevent Diabetes.  Will follow up with her in one month to check her progress and cheer her on.   KWellsRN

3/20/2013  Member returned my call.  States he has been diabetic for 9 years, and he was never a person to go to the dr unless something was terribly wrong.  He has neuropathy in his legs.  He takes several different medications for the diabetes, including Lantus at night.  He checks his bs twice daily- it ranges between 110-240.  Has appt to have his labs checked with md next week.  States he knows she is going to ?yell? at him because of his labs.  His labs  were high right after the holidays- he doesn?t get much exercise in the colder winter months, but when it warms up he exercises more and his diabetes is better managed. He does walk his dogs at night and he walks a lot at work.   His dr does monitor his kidney function, and has encouraged him to see an ophthalmologist for a diabetic eye exam, and also a colonoscopy.  He does not remember what his A1c was at last check.  He eats many things that he knows he shouldn?t, per his report, but doesn?t feel the need to change.  Discussed the long term effects of elevated bs/A1c- possible blindness, kidney damage, etc.  Reminded him that his body has already suffered neuropathy, that is not reversible, we want to prevent further damage.  Neither are eye and kidney damage reversible.  Reminded that even though he doesn?t feel that damage is occurring, it is.  Encouraged him to see eye dr for dilated eye exam, explained reason for this.  Discussed his diet- he is eating cheerios and a banana for breakfast, with 2%milk, and sometimes adds a muffin to that.  Encouraged to add some protein in, and perhaps only banana, and not eat the muffin.  Encouraged to try changing small things at the time- adding protein with each meal and cutting back on carbohydrates.    He does like boiled eggs, will start eating a boiled egg with breakfast.  He prepares most of the meals at home.  He usually takes a sandwich for lunch and chips.  He knows he needs to not have the chips- encouraged to change this to a small piece of fruit.  Discussed changing from white bread to whole grain, from white to brown rice.  States he eats sugar free cookies?sometimes several of them with 2-3 glasses of milk, he has cut back some on the milk-  he didn?t realize that the sugar free cookies  still have lots of carbohydrates and this affects the blood sugar.     KWellsRN
He had lost weight, from 204 down to 187, but is back up to 197 at this time.  Congratulated him on losing the weight, encouraged him to work toward taking it back off.  As the weather warms up he will be more active, and states the weight will come off.    KWellsRN
Will check back with him in about three weeks to see how his md visit went.  Encouraged him to visit the DDHC website.

Hi mem, hope you are doing well. I got my results back from the health screening a few days ago so I thought it's time to set the new goals. I am going to try to loose at least 7 to 8 pounds. I am going to watch what I eat more carefully especially with the holidays coming up. I noticed my cholesterol level was higher than it was last year. Not eating a lot of fried foods so it may be from the diet sodas I'm drinking so I'm going to cut those way down and try to find  more cholesterol friendly foods to eat. I am still doing sit ups every other day and the elliptical at least 3 to 4 times a week. I am going to cut out the beer all together, even though it's been light beer. Don't need it anyway. I'm waiting to hear back from the gynecologist on my sonohystergram. My biopsy came back with good results though. He did say though that I was completely menopausal and put me on hormone medicine which I take every morning and something else I take every night. I have a fibroid inside my uterine lining. Just waiting to hear back from the last test and see what he says my options are. I am still counting my daily calories which is helping a lot too. I will take my results with me the next time time I see my regular physician though to go over it with me. If you need any additional info for my goals please let me know. Thank you mem

Spoke with member in regards to triglyceride level 614. Member states he has never been told his chol or trig levels are high and no family hx of high levels. He also states he seen his primary MD over the summer who drew labs, he states they were all normal. Member was encouraged to see MD that this level could lead to pancreatits. He states I might make an appt. Reinforced importance of seeing MD, offered to fax results to MD. NO MD was listed on paperwork. He didnt seem inclined to offer fax # of MD.
TEP #3 Spoke with her about different types of NRT. The patch vs the gum. She doesn't feel she needs a constant flow of nicotine so I suggested speaking with her physician about  the gum option as this would just give her nicotine when needed. Has an appointment to speak with her physician tomorrow afternoon. Once she has decided a type of NRT we will move forward with a goal and plan to quite smoking. 
She is doing well, she is attending a grief support group to help with the loss of her brother.   She had a mammogram in August that showed something in her right breast, she will go for repeat in Jan 2014.  The most recent skin graft to her nose did not heal as expected, she had steroid injection in the scar and massages it daily several times to help it to soften and smooth out.  She is feeling well, stays up to date on her routine screenings with her MD, and feels she is taking good care of herself.  
Agrees that 1st goal is to obtain a PCP by checking for MD in network, calling MD office to see if taking new pts and make an appt, then let this nurse know. 
Stated BP has been up a few other times, but it was when he broke a bone or had a car accident, so his BP would naturally be up then. BP was at 154/99 at KYN. Agrees to reduce fast food & fried foods and cut down from 5 beers/week to 2. Agrees to walking 15-20 min./day to start and then increase intensity & time. Has worked out before and lost down to 218# last yr. Is 243 now and goals to get down to 220#; to reduce BP and chol to WNL. "

"SENT attachments, wise fats and tips: Thanks for taking time to speak with me today. It was my pleasure.  I hope our conversation & the attachments above are helpful. Below is a review/reminder of what we discussed for your goals and action plans. Goals are what you want to achieve. Action plans are what you plan to do to reach those goals. Don?t be overwhelmed by the amount of items you see below. Several are repeats. The point to take from this is that exercise and a healthy diet effects/changes everything. Goals 1: Find a PCP & see them Action plans: ?	check to see if MD is in-network with benefit plan?	call MD office to see if they are taking new patients ?	make an appt with MD for a PE (Physical Exam) and a ?new patient appt? if necessary ?	call/email RN/health coach your MD appt date Goal 2: Reduce BP to WNL (within normal limits, which is <120/80) Action plans: ?	start exercising 15-20 min/day  ?	reduce salt shaker use ?	reduce fast foods Goal 3: Reduce cholesterol from 208 to WNL (which is <200) Action plans: ?	start exercising 15-20 min/day  ?	reduce fast foods ?	reduce fried foods Goal 4: Reduce BMI by reducing weight from 243# to 220 by end of benefit plan yr Action plans:  ?	start exercising 15-20 min/day  ?	reduce fast foods ?	reduce fried foods ?	reduce beer from 5/week to 2/week Warm Regards,
Poor follow thru on previous teaching.  Not checking bg's - states \my wife checks it\" - states \"I don't feel bad.\"   - RN teaches re rationale for him taking ownership of own bg and diet.  Reviewed lab results - GFR or 74 - and may have CKD - or he is at high risk of.  Teaching re stages of CKD and interventions for reducing this risk.  He states bp's have been 120's/70's and he is checking ~ 1 x per wk.  He agrees to begin checking bg's ac and recording his meals.  He will use tools RN sent.  He is using HEALTH DIARY.  Teaching re which labs to record on the diary.  He will have MD fax next labs to us.  "

"Hello member, My apologies, it was my understanding last year that Dr's Health had access to our insurance claims to the degree you could see if we were compliant. Here is a listing of the dates I believe you need in order for me to be no more than 1 issues out of compliance. My annual well women checkup which included a pap was performed on July 23, 2013 with Dr. Rizzo, UTMB Clinic located in Webster, TX.  
I had been under the care of a PCP with visits every 6 months - Dr. Ginn, UTMB, League City, TX. - she relocated to California in September and I was fortunate to be able to locate a new PCP physician who had an opening on short notice for a new patient physical and to review the 'know your numbers' document.  This appointment was October 25, 2013  with Dr. Strickline - UTMB Clinic, League City, TX.   My last mammogram was October of 2012, Dr Rizzo left orders on file at the UTBM Specialty Center, League City TX and I have a schedule date for this coming November 15th.

"Sorry that I was a little slow getting this to you. I had to go to a meeting. Thanks for taking time to speak with me today ............ I KNOW you are a busy woman. SIG is blessed to have you there. Here is a review & reminder of what we discussed: You have a MD appt on 11/22/2013. ?	Remember to ask him to look in your chart & tell you when you had your colonoscopy ?	You may want to also consider getting a flu vaccination if you haven?t already ?	Shoot me an email after your MD appt & let me know how it went Goals:  ?	to reduce A1c from 5.7 to WNL (within normal limits, 5.6 or <) ?	reduce chol from 216 to WNL (<200) ?	maintain BP WNL (<120/80) Action Plans (what to do to reach your goals): ?	Continue to take BP & chol meds. ?	Continue to drink water and not sugared drinks ?	Greatly reduce intake of sweet foods (Sweet 16 donuts, blueberry muffins, candy, candy bars, poptarts & baking cookies). ?	Obtain Stevia to use as a sweetener for coffee, etc. Exercise:?	continue to walk daily at breaks and after work at least 15-30min/day ?	learn how to squat correctly & lunge (www.sparkpeople.com & maybe a trainer at the YMCA) Just a couple more things I thought of?Are you taking a supplement or medication for your arthritis?
All About Carb Counting is 2 sided sheet giving ideas of how to reduce carbs in your diet. Remember anything white turns to sugar in your blood stream (sugar, flour or anything made from them like sweet foods, breads, cereals, potatoes, rice, pasta, etc.), so reduce them as much as possible. 
To answer your question, how many carbs to have in one day depends on your wt, activity level and what your body responds to. Sparkpeople can help you with deciding where to start with that. When I started on my health journey, sparkpeople is where I started, but their recommendations were a little high. So what I suggest to folks is to go by their recommendations if they are less than what you are already doing. Then reduce them until your body (or BS/A1c) responds. Since you don?t need to lose wt, you can continue to eat carbs, but make them healthy high fiber carbs (not empty calories)?like eating whole grain brown rice instead of white rice. (I was blown away when I found out that the white rice isn?t ?whole grain?!) Eat ?whole grain? bread instead of enriched/refined flour types of bread. Eat whole grain pasta (or eliminate it from your diet like I did). Most starchy veg. or food servings are only ? cup. That?s not much pasta, so I just don?t eat that anymore. 
This kind of diet change takes a mind change. I try to look at food as a source of fuel for my body and I have the option of putting toxins in it or healthy stuff. You?re worth the good healthy stuff. Avoid the mindset that ?I deserve it? after you work out. That?s kind of like saying ?I deserve to feed myself toxins after I worked a few extra calories off?. Instead think of it this way?if I eat very healthy most of the time, then I can have a tasty dessert via planning ahead and substituting, once in a while. If you eat 10 sweet things/day, if you can?t quit all together, try to cut it in half or eat smaller amounts. 
Healthy Bk ideas: is just a few suggestions regarding Bk. Remember Bananas, ? of a large one is a serving and they have a high glycemic index so alternate eating those. Eggbeaters are a great choice too. 
You may want to have one of the guys there who exercise a lot and are knowledgeable, show you how to squat. Once you get that down pat, have them show you how to lunge. Do it slow and steady at 1st so you don?t hurt yourself. Remember to never allow your knee to move forward past your toes.

"member, Hello!  My name is name name.  My husband, name, is an employee at Cape Environmental Management, Inc.  I have received my health screening lab results and the information accompanying it.  I have a question for you regarding the compliance grid.  I recently (mid-Sept) had my annual exam at my gynecologist's office.  Does that satisfy the requirement for a physical?  They checked my weight, BP, and I had an overall physical exam including Pap smear.  I did not get my cholesterol checked (this is specifically mentioned in the compliance grid), since Doctors Direct did the cholesterol screening already.  My cholesterol results were all within normal range.  So, do I need to have a physical with an Internal Medicine doctor, or will the check-up with my Gyn suffice?  Do I need to document this somehow to be compliant? Thank you,
"member, I was out of the office working last week sorry for the delay in getting back to you..... I have your labs in my hand. That is what you need to take to the Dr. to review for your physical.  l.  I will be glad to fax them to you.  I have called this am, and then realized when I did not get an answer that you are a FEW hours behind us and that you are still snuggly in your bed. Email me a FAX number and I will fax them right to you so that you can see your doctor.  
Remember to email me the receipt or date you had your appt and doctors name .  Please send me the date of your PAP and MAMMO for 2013. Happy Monday nurse

Over the past three years, he cut out sugar in his diet, decreased carbohydrate intake, increased his water intake, and has lost 15 pounds as a result.  His GOAL is to maintain his good health.

"Received this email from member, her answers are in capital letters:  Glad to hear your shoulder surgery went well and especially that you had no pain!!  And that you lost weight during your leave---that is awesome!  Did you continue with  Nutrasystem?  I AM OFF AND ON.  What is your weight now?  I HAD LOST A TOTAL OF 10 LBS.   And do you have a goal weight in mind?  It helps to set a goal, that way you know when you have arrived, and can celebrate!   I remember you were looking forward to being able to exercise more after the shoulder surgery.  With the back issues you should definitely check with your physician before starting anything new ( I know you probably know that already?).  Sometimes they will recommend low impact activities (water aerobics are particularly helpful).  I hope you get some resolution for the back problems soon. SO DO I!!! Any changes in your medications? NO Particularly your blood pressure medicine?  NO And are you tolerating the Lipitor (you started taking a whole tablet again, right?)? YES  I?m wondering when your MD will be repeating the lipid panel. Usually with weight loss, increased exercise, medication, and diet changes,  you will see the cholesterol numbers  improve.  I SEE HIM IN DECEMBER.   It?s a great feeling when you see the results of your hard work! Have a great evening, I look forward to hearing back from you!

Hey Name1, Hope this finds you well and enjoying the cooler temps & pretty colors of the trees. Just checking up on you to see how you are doing with the following: ?         How were your lab values in Oct at your MD appt? (triglycerides and A1c) Trigylcerides were even worse, 1500+. My doctor had me try Lovasa and she also set me up with a lipidologist. Good news though, my A1C was better. ?         Did you see the nutritionist? No. Not yet.          How are you doing at counting carbs? That part is going pretty well. ?         How are you doing at eating healthier and low fat? Even better. Good suggestion about the raw peppers as a snack. I actually like them! I've been having them in the afternoons with a little hummus. ?         Are you able to fax me your labs? Will do. ?         How is your pancreas doing? Fine I guess. No back pain that usually signals problems.
Here are my recent labs. I don't see my A1C on here anywhere, but it was 6.8.\"
Continue conversation about healthy eating & exercise. Treshay continues with her running program.

Member called because she rec'd a letter in the mail concerning lab results.  Reviewed labs over the phone.  Concern is elevated cholesterol and member is already taking chol meds.  Member states she is to see doctor on Friday Nov 1.  Asked if company would fax over lab results and PNF form.  
Mr. Nmae followed up with his physician after receiving his results. Meds for diabetes were increased from 2 per day to 3. BP meds were increased from 1 daily to 2 daily plus a diuretic. Still drinking alcohol 6-8 beers per day but his own words, \ no hard liquor.\""
"Treshay is continuing to do well. Current weight 185# She has lost 10 lbs since 6/28/13. She can now run back and forth over the Ringling Bridge without stopping. She runs the bridge 5 days per week. Today we discussed the pitfalls of dining out. We looked at calorie/fat content of favorite restaurant choices, such as green bean crispers from Applebee's. She was advised to use Calorie King & My Fitness Pal to help keep track of food intake and to learn the caloric content of foods.  New Goals: lose 5 lbs by next appointment. Increase her intake of fruits & vegetables." 
Pre-diabetes Exercise, Weight Loss
It also looks like she saw her Primary Care Physician on  FEB 18, 2013 and from the diagnosis listed I know he did a physical. 
That would mean she is ?compliant?  through March of 2014 for a PHYSICAL.  If she sees her medical doctor between now and  the end of March 2014  email me and let me know and I can extend her compliance DATE for her physical.  The CAPE guidelines are that you need to have a Primary Care Physician and  have to see them once a year or every 12 mos she has completed this part.   
CAPE guidelines asked that females have a PAP exam every year and a MAMMO every 2yrs.  I don?t see claims for these in the last 2 yrs.  She needs to get these to be compliant for  2013.  Because the last date I have is PAP in 2010 and Mammo in 2010.   Claims show up in my system 6-8 wks later so if she has had these test done, email me the date, doctors name and the city and state the doctors office is in.
I have the date of her colonoscopy as 9/20/12. That is from? Claims? in her record.
Your wife has 2 non compliant points for 2013 and that would put you paying the higher premium.
If you will send me the info requested above I will be glad to make changes to your compliance.

Tracking your nutritional intake on www.sparkpeople.com will help tremendously, even if you only do it for 2 weeks. There is also a smart phone app ($3.99 cost) which makes it very easy to keep up with. Are you taking a multi-Vitamin? I highly recommend a healthy multi-Vit. For men (one that really digests so your body is able to benefit from it). Hope this is helpful.Let me know how you are doing by calling or emailing me monthly is what I suggest. Then give me your current wt, latest BP, how you are doing with exercise and with healthy eating. 
I just got my Know Your Numbers paperwork. According to your email below, all my numbers should be under the 50% modifiable risk and you said I do not need a physical. So I canceled the physical appointment. However, reviewing the paperwork I just received, I actually have 1 modifiable risk at 50% and another at 60% which would mean I have to get a physical or  pay the higher rate. This is the same exact thing that happened last year. If you recall, you told me I did not have to get  a physical because my numbers were all in line and then I got hit with the higher rate because they actually were not. And I had to keep paying until I was able to get a physical. Thankfully, I was reimbursed for most of this. Last year I figured it was just a mistake, but now that it has happened again, can you please review my records and make sure that they are correct? My concern is either I am getting the wrong information in the mail or you have the wrong information in your system since what you have told me now two years in a row has been inaccurate with the results I receive in the mail.
We need to talk then because your records do not match the paperwork that I have. Every year (including 2012), I have had a modifiable risk higher than 60% for diabetes and higher than 50% for stroke. So we need to get these records straight since it affects my health insurance. Somehow the records you have in your system that you are reviewing do not match the paperwork I have here in my hands. 2011: Diabetes : 71% Stroke : 58% 2012:Diabetes: 62% Stroke: 51% 2013: Diabetes: 60% Stroke: 50%

Mr. Name states that he visits his physician every three months to have liver enzymes checked due to some problems that he has. He is currently prescribed Metformin and Glipizide. States that his A1C and glucose is due to cholesterol medication and steroid shots that he takes. 
Visited member to follow-up with regards to screening results. States that he only visits physician 1x yearly for checkup unless he gets sick. Takes fish oil for triglycerides and was taking medication for hypertension. Stopped taking BP medication, stating reason was readings have been good lately.

Mr. Name is a person i have struggled to get in compliance for a good while. His intentions are good but financial matters usually get in his way. He does not have primary physician and states that even co-pays are difficult for him. I have and continue to explain to him the importance of getting his checkups, usually to the tune of the same old outcome. I was able to get him a few years back to have tests and blood work done, and at that time, surprisingly his numbers were better than i would have ever expected. 
Mr. Nme states that he followed up with physician and was placed on small dosage of BP medication, HCTZ 12.5mg. Claims that his glucose checked out good during visit and would probably be able to come of med after losing some weight.
