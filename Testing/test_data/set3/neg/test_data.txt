I'm sorry that I have been hard to get ahold of as of late. For the last couple weeks I've been working from 8 am to 6 pm. Though I'm not able to reach you between the hours of 8:30 and 4:30, it is my hope that we are able to reach an agreement on a time to go over my test results. 
P.S. My usual work schedule is 10:00-6:00 but am currently seeing a lot of overtime. I do not know when this will change. Thank you for your time.
"Good morning!  Thank you for your reply! I completely understand, there aren't enough hours in the day it seems!  I will be out screening with another client from noon today until late tomorrow afternoon. Or I can email your results, which I certainly do not mind doing.  Because your results are confidential, I would need to send them encrypted- you would have to set up a password to open the email.  Is this something you would be interested in?  Or I can stay late Wednesday or Thursday evening to talk with you.  Just let me know which works best for you.  I'll be looking forward to hearing from you.

"I recently completed the know your numbers health screening. I have tried to call you but with the holiday and all I guess I missed you.  Now I was at my friends house and just for fun , as we were talking about the screenings, he checked my blood sugar and it was rediculous,(378). I am now terrified that my health is seriously declining. I have worked so hard to avoid my fathers lifestyle but got blind sided by the sugar, not in my family. Please tell me what else is going on. I am now in a panic to get educated and get this under control. I can only imagine what the other numbers are seeing as heart disease does in fact run in the family.  I hope we have caught this early enough to avoid any serious damage. thanks 
The number you have on your kyn form is no longer in service, call me right now. I am sitting by my phone!
I am going to call you now, if you aren?t there, I will leave a message. I am in the office this week Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday afternoon. Debbie

Went over results & QHA's. 
Met to do .  He claims he is not a diabetic.  Not on meds for GLU.  Encourage him to see his doctor ASAP.  Has started to watch his portions.  Still eating unhealthy at fast food every morning for breakfast.  Walks everyday for 45mins -1hr.  Has lost 8lbs since March.  
Met over the phone to do .  He said he is still not ready to quit.  He is smoking a little under a pack and a half a day.  Hoping to get his physical scheduled in the next week. 
"Hello!  Your results are as follows: 
Lab test			Value			Normal/Abnormal		Desired level: Blood Sugar		89			N				less than 100 Hemoglobin A1c	5.3		N				less than 5.7 Blood Pressure		124/77							120/80 and lower Total Cholesterol	171			N				less than 200 HDL (the good cholesterol)  50			N				above 40  LDL (the bad cholesterol) 109							less than 100 Triglycerides		62			N				less than 150 Body Mass Index	21.1			N				less  than 25
Your systolic blood pressure of 124 is just above the desired level of 120.  This can change from minute to minute.  Your LDL- the ?bad? cholesterol is just above the desired level of less than 100.  There are some things you can do to reduce the LDL.  With regard to diet:
*increasing the amount of whole grains and fiber in your diet can help reduce the LDL.  If you haven?t already, change from white bread/white rice/white pasta  to whole grain products.  Labels can be misleading- bread should say specifically that it is WHOLE GRAIN- NOT just MULTI grain.  Brown rice and whole grain pastas are widely available these days and provide more fiber in the diet than the regular bleached products that just break down to starch and sugar.  
*eat more fish high in omega-3 fatty acids instead of red meat, which is high in saturated fat.  Fatty fish like mackerel, lake  trout, herring , sardines, albacore tuna and salmon are high in omega -3 fatty acids.
Exercise is important in the management of  cholesterol.  Being more active- taking brisk 30 minute walks  several times a week is a good place to begin.  Do you have a regular exercise routine in place?  
CONGRATULATIONS!  Overall, your values are very good.  I would encourage you to continue utilizing good health habits.

He talked for about 23 minutes?states he almost hates coming home because he misses his wife so much.  He does have a dog, a german shepherd, that keeps him company.  He works in the nursing home, he feels needed and appreciated there by the residents.   KWellsRN

4/17/2013  Member called, states is doing well right now but had an exacerbation a couple weeks ago and had to go to the ER with his asthma.  He has noticed that all the while he is at work, he is coughing.  It doesn?t start until he gets to work- it doesn?t happen when at home.  He thinks it may possibly be from perfumes/cleaners/disinfectant at work, not sure what it is but he doesn?t cough like that at home.  He reports having difficulty staying asleep the entire night.  He wakes up about 3am and has to use his nebulizer so he can clear his lungs and rest better.  He does not have a peak flow meter- encouraged him to talk with his md about getting one.   He has noticed that he can sleep fine in the recliner all night but when lying flat he doesn?t rest as well.  Suggested that he use several pillows or a wedge to elevate his upper body when sleeping, maybe this will help.  He is going to ask his md about a sleep study also.  He hasn?t had allergy testing done in thirty years.  Mentioned that this may be something worth looking into, he will talk with his md about it.  
His cataract surgery went well last month and he is pleased with the improvement in his vision.  He is looking forward to a big fishing trip with friends next week.  Will check back with him in  six weeks to see how he is doing.

6/4/2013 Received email from member:  Please feel free to contact me via email. My reply: My apologies for taking so long to reply, I was out of state screening  in Pennsylvania the end of last week.  Just wanted to review your Know Your Number Results and see if you have any questions about them.  Privacy laws require that your personal health information be protected, so in order to discuss them via email you will need a password to access that information via an encrypted email.  I will send you an email following this one that just says ?password setup?- it will guide you through creating a password.  Once you have set up that password, please let me know, then I can send your results.  Hope you are having a great day!---KWells,RN
6/5/2013  Received email from member indicating that she has set up her password. Sent the following encrypted email:Hello Alicia,  Your results are as follows:
Fasting Blood Sugar- 			77		normal Hemoglobin A1c			5.2		normal Blood pressure				114/68		normal Total cholesterol			234		elevated- desired level is below 200 HDL (the ?good? cholesterol)		80		normal-  very good level LDL (the ?bad? cholesterol)		137		elevated- desired level is below 100 Triglycerides				84		normal  desired level is below 150 Overall your results are very good!  Congratulations on an excellent blood pressure!  You are doing something right ? The two areas that could use some tweaking are your total cholesterol, and your LDL.  There are some things you can do to help reduce these. With regard to your diet- Adding fiber is a good way to help control cholesterol.  Fiber is not absorbed by the body- it actually absorbs cholesterol and fat and takes it away.  Try adding whole grains to your diet., This is a good way to increase  fiber, by changing from white bread/rice/pasta to whole grain products.  Thankfully, there is an ever increasing variety of whole grain products available these days.  Reducing saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol in your diet can improve triglyceride levels as well as help manage cholesterol. Limit your intake of red meat to help reduce saturated fat intake. Eat more fish high in omega-3 fatty acids instead of red meat, which is high in saturated fat.  Fatty fish like mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna and salmon are high in omega-3 fatty acids.  Regular exercise is very helpful in helping reduce cholesterol  --even just ten minutes, three times a day is beneficial. A few questions for you- Do you have a regular exercise routine?  What does it include? Does elevated cholesterol run in your family? Have you seen your physician to review your results?  What changes, if any,  did he/she recommend? I?m looking forward to hearing your response.  I am attaching some information you may find helpful. ---KWells,RN
6/6/2013  Received email from member: Good evening.  Thank you for sending the results.  I have not discussed these with my doctor, as I am trying to lower the LDL and total cholesterol on my own first, as I do not want to be put on a drug for the rest of my life.I currently exercise 7 days a week - from 1 hour or more.  I am an athlete; swimming, biking, running, weight training, stretching, circuit training and yoga.  I participate in triathlons, marathons, mountain biking, road biking, open water swimming, masters swimming (pool), etc... I currently take the following vitamins/supplements:  multi vitamin, calcium, CoQ10, Red Yeast Rice, garlic, fish oil, C, and fiber. I do not eat white bread, rice or pasta - I eat brown rice, whole grain breads and pastas.  I avoid sugar; I do not drink soda, iced tea, coffee, alcohol, or most fruit juices.  I drink orange juice, diluted (1/4 juice to 3/4 water).  I strive to eat un-processed foods.  I do not eat fish - I eat a lot of chicken, making an effort to eat less red meat; eat more vegetables.  I've incorporated a meatless day each week.  I've replaced dairy milk with soy milk.  I do not eat fast food.
My response via email: WOW!!  You are awesome!!  You are doing all the right things, and then some!!  I am wondering if there is a family history of elevated cholesterol issues- if you are doing all these right things, but the cholesterol doesn?t come down, there may be a genetic component to your cholesterol elevation.  If that is the case, it is very difficult to reduce cholesterol without medication. I completely understand not wanting to be on a cholesterol medication- and you are definitely doing everything right to keep from going that route. Certainly it will be good to have your physician re-check your labs to evaluate your progress. Please let me know if I may be of assistance.  Have a great day!

4/16/2013  Member called to review KYN results.  He went to his dr. after the screening and his bp was in 130s over 80 something, he cannot remember the exact number.  He has a bp cuff at home and checks it regularly.  He has some white coat syndrome- said his bp often goes up when he get to the drs office, but after he sits down and gets still for a few minutes, it returns to normal.  Reviewed bs 100, A1c 6.0, and ADA guidelines that put him in the moderate risk category for developing diabetes.  He isn?t experiencing any symtoms of elevated bs.  No family history of diabetes.    He typically eats oatmeal for breakfast, a tuna sandwich, yogurt, and apple sauce or pudding for lunch.  We discussed ways to decrease sugar/carbohydrate intake- looked at his breakfast oatmeal- the instant packet he has been using contains 13 grams of sugars and 27 grams of carbohydrates.  Homemade oatmeal has  less than one gram of sugar.  He will change to making his own oatmeal to help decrease his sugar/ carb intake.  Also encouraged him to have  lean protein at each meal.   Starting with a couple days a week to begin with, he could change breakfast to two boiled eggs and whole grain toast, or egg beaters and whole grain toast and a small serving of fruit.    
He doesn?t exercise very often besides what he does at work- although he is very active doing yardwork during the warm months.  Encouraged him to add in walking on a daily basis whenever possible, enough to raise his heart rate.  Stressed that exercise is a very important part of staying healthy.  
He was concerned about a sheet that he brought home with him from his recent md appt, it listed as a diagnosis for him chronic kidney disease, stage 3 moderate?- but he didn?t know anything about it?stated he wasn?t told anything about that at the md office.  Encouraged him to call the md back for clarification .
