Called member to follow up with quitting process for using<START:habit> tobacco <END>pouches.  He is down to 2 pouches a day, and at the last session he was using 4 a day!  He is pleased with his progress.  He is using the delay method in the mornings, the longest that he has gone before putting in a pouch is 3-4 hours.  He finds that the key for him is staying busy and getting busy first thing in the morning.  He is having some<START:diagnosis> heart issues <END>--related to being exposed to<START:diagnosis> meningitis <END>in the past, has a<START:procedure> defibrillator <END>.  His doctors felt that it kept going off due to the<START:habit>nicotine<END>use, so that was his main motivator for quitting.  He is still having issues and to date has had to have 6-7 ablations.  This is starting to stress him out, and making him want to have more<START:habit>tobacco<END>, but is motivated enough to avoid.  He thinks that he is ready to go down to one pouch a day in the next week.  He is also balling up gum and keeping in his mouth to help avoid pouch use.  We discussed health benefits of quitting even though it has not yet made a difference with heart issues.  He still feels he is doing the right thing.  He is still working with his doctors to correct the issues.  He feels that the next step heart wise is to get a<START:procedure> transplant <END>.

Met with member to discuss<START:habit> tobacco <END>use.  She has been<START:habit> smoke <END>free in the past, longest time has been 7 months.  She is currently<START:habit> smoking  <END>around a pack a day.  She is getting motivated again to quit.  She does enjoy<START:habit> smoking <END>and knows that it is disgusting.  She is motivated to quit for her grandson, who now lives with him because she knows she is putting him at risk from having it show up in his lab work.  When she quit in the past she used the patch.  She will use this in the future.  She isn't quite ready to quit, said she was around a 6-7 on a scale of 1-10.  10 is ready to quit tomorrow, and 1 not at all ready to quit.  We talked about cutting back and using the delay method to start with before she seriously thinks about using the patches again.  She wants to follow up with me once she has more time to work through her grief.  Her son has passed away, sounded like an accident and she is seeing a therapist.  She knows that she needs to deal with that before focusing on quitting.

She didn't quit<START:habit> smoking <END>when she was<START:diagnosis> pregnant <END>, but she did cut back.  She knows this will be challenging.  She has a 3 month old granddaughter, so that is a good motivator.  she has already stopped<START:habit> smoking <END>in the house since granddaughter lives with her, which she believes is helping her to cut back.

When it comes to nutrition I told her to start off making sure you are getting at least 3 meals in a day ESPECIALLY BREAKFAST.  In all three of those meals trying to incorporate a fruit or vegetable.  If you are eating any type of breads or pastas make sure they are Whole Grain.  Try sticking to mostly chicken, turkey, and fish.  Red meat twice a week is plenty.  Invest in Almonds or nuts as snacks.  Eggs are a cheap and great source of protein.  Portion control is key.  Take your time when you eat.  It takes 20 minutes for your stomach to tell your brain you are full.  Try to eliminate or cut down on the amount of soda you are drinking.  If you are drinking regular soda try and switch to diet soda.
