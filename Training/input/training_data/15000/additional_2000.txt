"Thanks for taking time to return my call. It was a pleasure to talk with you.
I hope our conversation was helpful and that you find the above attachments helpful as well.
Here are reminders of what we discussed, for your review:
?	Goals: wt of 235# & to be healthy
?	<START:habit> Exercise<END>:

You also may want to do the following to help your <START:vital> blood sugar <END> stay steady throughout the day (which will help you lose wt too):
?	Take in at least 3 fresh whole fruits each day (not canned). They are all natural, healthy carbs & contain lots of vitamins/minerals & fiber. 
?	Don?t drink calories (don?t drink sweet liquids like sweet tea, regular soda, juice or alcoholic beverages)
?	Avoid or at least minimize sweet foods. When you do eat them, don?t eat them on an empty stomach and substitute them for carbs at the previous meal. 
?	Eat every 3-4 hours throughout the day
Remember to take your KYN results/pkt with you when you attend your MD appt. 
Planning ahead is the best tip I can give you. You can do this. Just keep learning healthy living tips, apply them to your life and repeat.

"Hey ..............
Thank you so much for returning my call. It?s great to hear that you are already on a journey to a healthier lifestyle. Way to go!
Congrats on losing the 17#.  Keep taking baby steps, progressing towards a healthier lifestyle. 
Fad diets don?t work. Simply learn a healthy fact (tip), apply it to your life, keep doing it, learn another one, etc. That?s it. 
You are not alone. We are all on this journey together. You can do it and you?re WORTH it!
Just for review, here are some of the things we discussed:
?	Continue to reduce diet Coke intake (Yay! You reduced it by half already!)
?	Continue <START:habit> exercising <END> (maybe <START:habit> walk <END> for 15 min on the other 4 days?)
?	When you want to drink a glass of <START:habit> wine <END> or eat a dessert, skip eating any carbs for dinner (or previous meal)
?	Don?t eat sweets on an empty stomach
?	Try to eat every 3-4 hours throughout the day
?	Reduce/avoid red meat (eat more chicken, fish, turkey, nuts)
?	Reduce starchy foods and be aware of how much a serving is (most of the time it?s cup ?potatoes, rice, pasta, corn for example)
?	Eat at least 3 fresh whole fruits (learning which are low in the Glycemic Index & how much is a serving)
?	Keep your MD appt on Oct 20th
?	Make an appt with MD for 3 months from now & ask him/her to recheck <START:vital> A1c <END> to see if what you?ve done with <START:habit> exercise <END> & diet have been enough to reduce it
Setting goals helps us reach them. What goal do you have in mind for diet Coke? How about making the first goal to be one/morning and one/afternoon? Something to reach for. Just a suggestion.
Whatever you are comfortable with and how fast or slow you want to move is fine. Just keep heading in the right direction as you are now.  ;o)
I hope you find the above attachments helpful. I recommend printing the ?Tips for a Healthier You?, reviewing it, placing today?s date beside any tip/bullet you are already doing, place it on your frig, and keep adding a tip to your lifestyle weekly or monthly, however fast or slow you want to change. I hope this isn?t too much information at once. I don?t mean to overload you. Please feel free to call or email for questions, support or additional information. 
I am here to assist you with your journey to a healthier lifestyle and to reach your health goals. 
It was a pleasure speaking with you. Thanks for the encouraging words. You made my day. 
Its not often that we hear ?thanks? in a customer relations setting, as I?m sure you experience as well. 
I look forward to hearing from you. 
Remember, if we don?t quit?we win (Gal 6:9). 
Warm Regards,
Hopefully I will be able to jumpstart some L-B loss.  I did a little research yesterday and today and  found a few more resources you can add to your arsenal of suggestions.
There is a free app (at least it is free on the Google Marketplace) called ?Sworkit?.  The cool part about this app is that it syncs with ?MyFitnessPal? automatically adjusting the calorie count for the day.  Also the app customizes a work out for you depending on different variables including duration, muscle group, and type (<START:habit> cardio<END> /<START:habit> yoga <END> vs. strength training).  It also seems that most of the <START:habit> workout <END> suggestions are bodyweight <START:habit> exercises <END> only.
Another resource I found actually came to me as I was <START:habit> walking <END> on the <START:habit> treadmill <END> at the <START:habit> gym<END> .  There is a show on Food Network called ?Hungry Girl?.  The episode I watched had a multitude of quick-made, low calorie foods (which I believe is her shtick).  For lunch today I made one of her recipes for ?Scoopable Chinese Chicken Salad? (link) and much to my surprise, it was delicious, filling and low on calories.
Just thought I would pass along some stuff I stumbled across since we spoke.
10/02/13 VM from Name789 after I had LM concerning Name890's status.  States she will have 2 more <START:procedure> surgeries<END>.  2nd <START:procedure> surg <END> scheduled 10/25 which will be the creation of the J pouch.  3rd <START:procedure> surgery <END> approximately 4 wks later for the <START:procedure> ileostomy <END> takedown.
Left message for member to return my call to review KYN results.  Also mailed letter asking that member return my call.
"Wow! Great info. Thanks for sharing. 
We have been very acquainted with ?Hungry Girl?. I?ll have to try the recipe.
Have not heard of ?Sworkit? before now. Will check it out & add it to my tool belt. 
Thanks again and keep up the good work. 
Let me know when you make an appt for your physical in Dec. 
Left message for member to return my call to review KYN results.  Also mailed a letter asking that she call me.

She will follow up with her physician to have labs rechecked.

Fasting <START:vital> Blood Sugar<END> -  98   This is normal.  The desired range is below 100.
<START:vital> Blood Pressure <END> 138/94   The desired level is below 120/80.  At 138/94, your <START:vital> blood pressure <END> is elevated.   Does this run in your family?  Do you have a <START:vital> BP <END> monitor at home that you could check your <START:vital> BP <END> with, and keep a record of the readings to share with your physician?  
Lowering the amount of salt in your diet can help reduce your <START:vital> blood pressure<END>.  Salt (sodium) is found in fast food, canned food, restaurants, sauces, tomato products, cheese, snack foods.  Look for American Heart Assoc. Heart on freezer meals and canned soups, indicating that they contain less sodium.  Rinse canned vegetables, tuna, etc., to reduce the amount of sodium.  If your physician prescribes <START:vital> blood pressure <END> <START:drug> medication<END>, take it as scheduled.  If you experience side effects, tell your doctor so you can work together to find something you can tolerate.  
Total <START:vital> cholesterol  <END> 254   Elevated.  The desired level is below 200.  
<START:vital> Triglycerides   <END> 331  Elevated.  The desired level is below 150.  
With regard to <START:vital> cholesterol <END> and <START:vital> triglycerides<END>:  It is beneficial to have plenty of fiber in your diet.  Fiber is not absorbed by the body- it absorbs <START:vital> cholesterol <END> and fat and helps remove it from the body.  Try adding whole grains to your diet- such as whole wheat toast, brown rice, whole wheat multi grain crackers or bagels.  <START:habit> Exercise<END> ?even ten minutes a day?will help in managing  your <START:vital> cholesterol <END> and <START:vital> triglycerides<END>.   Reducing saturated fat, trans fat, and <START:vital> cholesterol <END> in your diet can improve <START:vital> triglyceride <END> levels as well as help manage <START:vital> cholesterol<END>.  <START:habit> Alcohol <END> has strong effects on <START:vital> triglyceride <END> levels.  Drinking more than one drink a day for women or two for men can raise <START:vital> triglyceride <END> levels considerably.  Some people with high <START:vital> triglycerides <END> may need to cut out <START:habit> alcohol <END> entirely.
Eat more fish that are high in <START:drug> omega<END>-3 fatty acids in stead of red meat, which is high in saturated fat.  Fatty fish like mackerel, lake trout, herring, sardines, albacore tuna and salmon are high in <START:drug> omega<END>-3 fatty acids. 
Fresh fruits and vegatables are a great way to increase fiber in your diet.  
Do you have a regular physician?  Have you  reviewed  your screening results with him/her?  What recommendations did he/she make?  
What <START:drug> medications<END>, if any, do you take on a regular basis?  Do you have a regular <START:habit> exercise <END> program?
Lots of questions!  I look forward to your response.  Have a great afternoon!
